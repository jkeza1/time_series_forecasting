Current Score: 19,568.4 RMSE

Target Score: < 3,000 RMSE

Status: ðŸš§ Under Active Optimization

 ## Project Overview
Air pollution, particularly PM2.5, is a significant public health concern in urban environments like Beijing. This project involves building a robust forecasting system using historical air quality and weather data. The model is designed to understand the underlying environmental dynamics, including local emissions, regional pollution transport, and meteorological conditions

# Model Architecture:
The best performing model is a stacked LSTM designed to learn patterns from short-term to long-term dependencies hierarchically.
