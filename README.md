# time_series_forecasting

📋 Project Overview
Predict PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing using meteorological data and advanced deep learning. This project addresses air quality forecasting to support public health and environmental management.

⚠️ Current Status
Model Performance: Needs significant improvement
Kaggle Score: 19,568.4 (target: <3,000)
Key Challenge: Model producing NaN predictions during training

🎯 Immediate Focus Areas
Critical Issues to Address:
NaN Predictions: Model outputs NaN values during training

Data Quality: Input sequences contain NaN values that need cleaning

Feature Validation: Verify all 45 features are properly scaled and formatted

Model Stability: Address numerical instability in training

🏗️ Technical Approach
Feature Engineering (45 Features)
Cyclical time encoding (hour, day, month)

Meteorological interactions (temp-dew point, wind-pressure)

Rolling statistics (6, 12, 24-hour windows)

Lag features and weather variable transformations

Current Architecture
python
Bidirectional LSTM Sequence:
Input(36h, 45 features) → BiLSTM(128) → BiLSTM(64) → LSTM(32) → Dense(64→32→1)
🔧 Required Improvements
1. Data Cleaning
python
# Current issue: X_train_seq contains NaN values
print(f"NaN values in training data: {np.isnan(X_train_seq).any()}")
# → Returns True, needs immediate fixing
2. Model Stability
Implement gradient clipping

Adjust learning rate (currently 0.001)

Add more aggressive regularization

Use simpler architecture initially

3. Validation Strategy
Implement time-series cross-validation

Add better monitoring callbacks

Track training/validation divergence

🚧 Next Steps
Fix NaN Data: Clean input sequences before training

Simplify Model: Start with basic LSTM, then increase complexity

Hyperparameter Tuning: Systematic learning rate and batch size optimization

Feature Selection: Identify most predictive features from the 45

Advanced Regularization: Add dropout, batch normalization, weight decay

📊 Current Baseline
Initial Score: 19,568.4 (needs ~85% improvement)

Target Score: <3,000

Primary Issue: Training instability leading to NaN predictions

🎯 Success Metrics
Achieve RMSE < 3,000 on Kaggle leaderboard

Stable training without NaN values

Consistent validation performance

Meaningful feature importance rankings
